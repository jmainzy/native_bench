# Native Bench
LLM benchmark experiments for North American Indigenous languages.

In order to promote exploration of LLM capabilities by language learners and community members without pre-existing large test sets, this benchmark method allows for a variety of tests and is somewhat anecdotal in nature.  There is no comprehensive score but rather qualitative analysis on the nature of each LLM's abilities and errors.

Current languages:
- Choctaw
- Muscogee
